This code is in several different pieces. To compile the code you will need Juicer (see below)
and you need to run the command:
juicer merge main.js -s -f -o Google-Bump.js -m ""

To run a merge that will create a file to be installed in GreaseMonkey, you can run:
juicer merge main.js -s -f -o %appdata%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<PROFILE DIRECTORY>\gm_scripts\google_bump\google_bump.user.js -m ""
e.g.
juicer merge main.js -s -f -o %appdata%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\eyo2kaec.default\gm_scripts\google_bump\google_bump.user.js -m ""

Do note that if you have Google Bump and Juicer on a different hard drive from your %appdata% then 
it will finish but it will throw an error.

This code uses juicer to compile from several different javascript files.
